There was no hope for him this time: it was the third stroke. Night after night
I had passed the house (it was vacation time) and studied the lighted square of
window: and night after night I had found it lighted in the same way, faintly
and evenly. If he was dead, I thought, I would see the reflection of candles on
the darkened blind for I knew that two candles must be set at the head of a
corpse.
